This repository contains the contents of a short open course designed by Jeremy H. Kidwell and Alex Fenlon at the University of Birmingham. The module explores ethical and legal issues surrounding contemporary academic research and engagement with (especially digital) data.

Directory structure includes:

* `docs` a folder containing the compiled book in html, .pdf and epub formats
* `course.bib` a bibliography of items used for the course in [BibTeX format](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/)
